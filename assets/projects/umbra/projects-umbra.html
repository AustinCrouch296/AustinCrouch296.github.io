                    <b>Umbra</b> is a virtuality-reality Atmospheric Horror game that I created for my dissertation study at Bournemouth University.
                    <br/><br/>
                    My dissertation, <em><b>"Designing a Horror Puzzle Game in Virtual Reality Using a Heartbeat Monitor"</b></em>, analyzed the development process and playtesting periods, and answered conclusions as to what makes a VR game feel immersive, unsettling, and interesting to play. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    While the VR experience only contained a few puzzles and scripted events, the game's unnerving atmosphere and environmental audio were very effective at keeping the player's immersed. The user study combined with heartrate monitor readings uncovered very insightful information about the games strengths and weaknesses.

                <h3>Setting of Umbra</h3>
                <p>You find yourself inside of a small room, the furniture around you appears to be old and covered up as if the home has been long abandoned.</p>
                <p>The feeling of being in a home is meant to instill a sense of familiarity and comfort in the player. Then as they travel further through the housegrow, they will notice objects that are not quite right, and become increasingly unsettled.</p>  
                <p>To create the environment, I found the ___ asset pack on the Unity Store and I was able to begin creating a layout of the level, keeping in mind which rooms could be created with the available assets. I created the level's design, including arrows showing how the player should progress to the end.</p>

                <h3>Ambient Audio Areas</h3>
                <p>Once the game's level was split into different rooms, I wanted to implement sounds to keep the player immersed in the environment.</p>
                <p>I started with ambient sounds from objects, like the flames in the lounge's fireplace crackling, and the grandfather clock ticking. These sounds would get louder as the player approached the object.</p>
                <p>Then each room had it's own atmospheric audio that would match the mood of its environment. Such as the bathroom having the sounds of dripping pipes, and the lounge having creaking floor boards from the rooms above it, and the dining room having a humming noise from it's single dim lightbulb.</p> 
                <p></p>Some of the audio was also shared between multiple rooms - the upstairs rooms of the house had the sound of heavy rainfall on the roof above them, while the downstairs area was more silent, with more open space that allowed for ambient noises like the piano and grandfather clock in the lounge to be heard throughout them.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="flex-full">
                <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
                <p>Umbra's gameplay loops focused around a simple mechanic - the player would have to search around their environment to find an object that they needed to progress to the next area.</p>
                <p>The first two rooms serve as a tutorial for the player. The first room is contains a few interactable objects for the player to pick up and activate, including a key to the door that they must put in the door's keyhole to progress. The second room contains a bunch of fake keys, with hints written on objects for the player to learn that they will need to solve puzzles in order to progress.</p>  
                <p>The game has a simple progression system where the player solves a puzzle, earns a key, and uses that key to unlock a specific door to access the next area. The player must solve 4 puzzles in exit the upstairs area, and then a large puzzle on the ground floor unlocks a key to the basement that allows the player to make their escape.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="flex-full">
                <h3>VR Interaction</h3>
                <p>Umbra's VR was created greatly in part to a Unity plugin called <a href="https://www.vrtk.io/">VRTK (Virtual Reality Toolkit)</a>, and was built and run off of my HTC Vive Cosmos using SteamVR.</p>
                <p>VRTK helped in making interactable objects, both grabbable (like a flashlight or key) and controllable (pushable buttons, pullable drawers). It also was used to set up a working VR Rig with both locomotion and teleport controls, as well as a long-distance pointer to pick objects up.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="flex-half">
                <h3>Brief Overview of Puzzles</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>Twin Bedroom</b> - The player must locate the real key in a room full of fakes, objects around the room hint to the location of the real key.
                </p>                
                <p>
                    <b>Bathroom</b> - Four dials are located on the wall, with unique symbols on each side. Four objects in the room have the correct symbols etched on them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Master Bedroom</b> - A scrambled painting must be rotated until it displays its proper image. This gives the player a hammer that can be used to smash a glass display case containing the key.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Dining Room</b> - Multiple mannequins posing around a diner table, each missing different body parts which the player must reattach to their bodies to unlock access to the kitchen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Library</b> - There is a large safe with a 4 digit passcode, each number correlating with a different color. The player must find the numbers hidden in the other rooms, but hints to where each of the digits can be found once they gain access to the kitchen.
                </p>

            <div class="flex-full">
                <h3>Player Events</h3>
                <p>In order to keep the gameplay experience the same for all the players in my test study, I decided that Umbra should have specific planned events. These events are controlled by invisible box colliders that activate when the player enters within their boundaries.</p>
                <p>A few of the events control the entity that lives in the house, trapping you in a room as it wails and charges down the hallway at you, or watches you through the cracks in the wall, before dissapearing and whispering right behind you. These events, while cruel, allowed for a baseline to be set with the heartrate monitor readings.</p>
                <p>Other player events are smaller, such as a piano beginning to play when the player enters in the foyer - the melody continues to play out until the end, or until the player approaches the piano and is startled by a loud slam on the keys.</p>
